# Welcome to MyFi ‚Äì A Next-Generation Science Fiction Book Recommendation System

Hey there! I'm excited to share MyFi with you ‚Äì my passion project that brings sci-fi book recommendations into the 21st century. It's a full-stack adventure where I've combined my love for coding, machine learning, and of course, science fiction & fantasy literature.

## About MyFi

I built MyFi from scratch as an end-to-end solution that connects readers with their next favorite sci-fi books. It's the culmination of my work across frontend development, API design, and data pipeline engineering ‚Äì all working together to create personalized reading experiences.

## What Makes MyFi Special

### üß† Smart Recommendations That Actually Work
I crafted a Python recommendation engine that combines content-based filtering with collaborative techniques. By analyzing user ratings and enriching book metadata from OpenLibrary, the system makes suggestions that feel personally curated. I'm particularly proud of the fuzzy matching algorithms I implemented to connect books across different data sources.

### üíª Full-Stack Craftsmanship
The frontend is my playground for React and TypeScript, creating an interface that's both beautiful and intuitive. Behind the scenes, I've built a Node.js/Express API with JWT authentication that talks smoothly to MongoDB ‚Äì giving the whole system a solid, scalable foundation.

### üîç Data Collection With a Personal Touch
One of my favorite challenges was building the data pipeline. Using Python with Selenium and BeautifulSoup, I created scripts that gather rich book data from across the web. Each book entry gets automatically enhanced with ISBNs, author details, and user reviews ‚Äì feeding the recommendation engine with quality information.

### üé® A Frontend That Feels Right
I've poured attention into making the user experience special ‚Äì from dynamic book panels that respond to your interests to little touches like smooth hover effects. Everything is responsive and designed to work beautifully whether you're on desktop or mobile.

### üèóÔ∏è Built to Grow
I designed MyFi with a modular architecture that separates the API, data processing, and frontend. This wasn't just for clean code ‚Äì it means each piece can evolve independently while still working harmoniously together.

## The Tech Stack I've Used

### Frontend
- React & TypeScript for building the interactive experience
- React Router & Context API for state management that makes sense
- Tailwind CSS for styling that adapts to any screen size

### Backend
- Node.js & Express powering a RESTful API that handles everything smoothly
- MongoDB via Mongoose for storing and retrieving book data efficiently
- JWT authentication to keep user sessions secure

### Data Collection & Enrichment
- Custom Python scripts using Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Pandas for wrangling and transforming the raw book data
- Fuzzy logic algorithms I implemented to match books across different sources

## Why I'm Proud of MyFi

This project represents my journey as a developer ‚Äì from conceptualizing a complex system to bringing it to life with code. It showcases my ability to:

- Own a project end-to-end, connecting all the dots between data, backend, and frontend
- Implement advanced algorithms that solve real user problems
- Build scalable systems that can grow with increasing data and users
- Find creative solutions to challenges like extracting structured data from the web

MyFi isn't just about demonstrating technical skills ‚Äì it's about creating something useful that combines my passion for technology and literature.

Thanks for checking out MyFi! Feel free to explore the code, dive into the documentation, or reach out if you'd like to chat about how it all works.
